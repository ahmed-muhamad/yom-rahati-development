# Yom rahati website

A website that searches for country holidays

## Motivation behind this website

I always hear about holidays from family members, so, I thought wouldn't be helpful, if there's a quick way to check, if today is a day off instead of wondering why there aren't many people outside.

That's where yom-rahati comes in!

It lets you check if today is a holiday day. Plus, it displays the previous holidays and the future ones.
